&lt;p&gt;Hi! My name is Antonio and I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer. I&amp;rsquo;m from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=tenerife+time+lapse&#34;&gt;Tenerife,
Spain&lt;/a&gt;, but
now living in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=finland+time+lapse&#34;&gt;Helsinki,
Finland&lt;/a&gt;. Over
the years I have lived and worked in Bilbao, Madrid, Brussels, Montreal and San
Francisco, and hold great memories of each place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professionally, I used to work on the backend side of things, but for some years
I decided to move into machine learning, even getting a MSc. on the topic.
However, after a few years in and around that field I decided that pure backend
engineering and distributed systems is what I enjoy doing the most, so nowadays
I do that, almost exclusively in the Go language, but of course the occasional
shell or python script is used as well. My tool set is Linux, Vim, Git, and a
browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I enjoy cooking with or for friends, eating, board games, and doing
exercise in the form of Judo and DaitoRyu, but I can be convinced to go on
running or climbing as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;contact&#34;&gt;Contact&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually hang around at the gophers slack under my @antoniomo handle. Other
than that, for professional contact just contact me on my LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;
