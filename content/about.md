Hi!

My name is Antonio and I'm a software developer. I'm from [Tenerife,
Spain](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=tenerife+time+lapse), but
now living in [Helsinki,
Finland](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=finland+time+lapse). Over
the years I have lived and worked in Bilbao, Madrid, Brussels, Montreal and San
Francisco, and hold great memories of each place.

Professionally, I used to work on the backend side of things, but for some years
I decided to move into machine learning, getting a MSc. on the topic.  However,
after a few years in and around that field I decided that pure backend
engineering and distributed systems is what I enjoy doing the most, so nowadays
I do that. I use the Go language whenever possible, but of course the occasional
shell or python script is useful as well. My tool set is Linux, i3 with a bunch
of terminals, Vim, Git, and a browser.

Personally, I enjoy cooking with or for friends, eating, board games, and doing
exercise in the form of martial arts, but I can be convinced to go on running or
climbing as well.

# Contact

I usually hang around at the [gophers slack](https://gophers.slack.com) under my
`@antoniomo` handle. Other than that, for professional contact just contact me on
my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoniomo/).
